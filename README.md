# Providers Table

## Running the App

Run the app with `npm start`

NOTE: It depends on a [Rails server](https://github.com/T-monius/providers-api) running on port 3001.

## Future Work

Kill some bugs.

Currently, if an NPI of a provider that is already on the table is input, the desired behavior of updating that record and moving it to the top is not performed.

It's not styled.

The code smell is real. Refactor.
